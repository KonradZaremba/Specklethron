# Specklethron

Specklethron is a highly advanced AI entity originating from Speckleverse, designed for efficient data search and retrieval. Thanks to its connection to the mother starship "Speckle," it can access your Building Information Modeling (BIM) data seamlessly. Specklethron can connect to your Speckle account and browse streams through a simple CLI interface, familiar to every hackathon enthusiast. Occasionally, it motivates developers to add some missing planned functionalities, enhancing the overall experience and capabilities of the system.

<b>Call to fellow developers</b>
Specklethron's ship was damaged and he has limited abilities to connect to his mother ship Speckle. You are more than welcome to fix parts and add additional modules.

<b>Alredy functioning parts of ship</b>:
  - Query data from streams
  - Query data from commits
  - Add commits to streams
  - Add test geometry to commits
  - Calculate basic quantities
  - Create new streams

<b>Parts of the ship to be fixed:</b>
  - commit comparison
  - 3D view
  - improve communication module with humans - add fancy chat UI
  - clean storage module and put things in containers - prefably MS.DI

<b>How to run the ship</b>
  - clone repo
