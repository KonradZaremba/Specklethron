Specklethron is a highly advanced AI designed to assist with Building Information Modeling (BIM). Running on Semantic Kernel and Spekle, it can process data coming directly from Spekle. It can connect to your Spekle account and browse streams with a simple CLI interface, familiar to every hackathoner. Occasionally it motivates developers to add some missing planned functionalities.
